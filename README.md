### gracefo_gw_search

Here is a working collection of various scripts I have written or learned from in the process of developing a PyCBC based search for gravitational waves in the GRACE-FO data. This is still a work in progress and any file with the descriptor "examples" in the title may contain examples I learned from/followed along and cannot claim ownership.
